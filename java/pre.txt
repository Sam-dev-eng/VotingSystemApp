often times we write our loop as

i = // initial loop control
while (i < endValue){
//loop body

i++
}

for (initial-action; loop-continuation-condition;
     action-after-each-iteration){
     //loop body
    Statement(s);
    }

example: 
        i = 0 ; (i < 100)? System.out.println("welcome to java");
        i++

 A for loop performs an initial action once, then repeatedly executes 
the statements in the loop body, and performs an action after an iteration when the 
loop-continuation-condition evaluates to true.

The for loop statement starts with the keyword (for) followed by a parentheses enclosing the structure of the loop.
The for loop is contained by three conditions.. 

 1. The initial action.
 2. The the loop continuation condition.
 3. The action after iteration (iteration means doing something over and over again, often with slight change each time).

These three conditions are seperated by semicolon (;) 
except the loop body which is enclosed by braces

int i;
 for (i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
 System.out.println("Good Morning");




 The loop control variable can be declared and initialized in the for loop. Here is an example:
 
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
 }
